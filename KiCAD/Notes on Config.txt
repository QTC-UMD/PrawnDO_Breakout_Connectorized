Should have been leaving notes on this as I was doing the iterations, but the idea just dawned on me.

There were a lot of changes made to this board in comparison to the folder marked "original".

All chips now have 10k resistors to all of their input traces. The chips were also moved further out to space out input traces and allow for addition of resistors.

Added more bypass capacitors at different values to see if that made any difference. It didn't seem to.

Tried splititng the power source between the four chips so that the run to the final chip wouldn't be as long and to shorten ground return paths. Also added jumper resistors (0 Ohms) to several places on the board for the same reason.


Mounting holes also need to be readded in this design since the components are no longer in the same spots.
